Question 1:
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family 
and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

Solution:
SELECT f.title AS movie,
	  c.name AS category,
	  COUNT(r.rental_date) AS rental_count
FROM rental AS r
JOIN inventory AS i
ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN film AS f
ON i.film_id = f.film_id
JOIN film_category AS fc
ON i.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN category AS c
ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY movie,
	    category
ORDER BY category;

Question 2:
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for.
Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) 
based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category 
that these family-friendly movies fall into.

Solution:
SELECT  title,
		name, 
		rental_duration, 
		NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
		
FROM 	    (SELECT f.title, c.name, f.rental_duration
			FROM film AS f
			Join film_category AS fc
			ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
			JOIN category AS c
			ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
			WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
			) AS subquery;

Question 3:
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. 
Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. 
Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

Solution:
SELECT  EXTRACT(month FROM r.rental_date) AS month,
	   EXTRACT(year FROM r.rental_date) AS year,
	   s.store_id AS store,
	   COUNT(r.rental_date)
	   
FROM staff AS st
JOIN rental AS r
ON st.staff_id = r.staff_id
JOIN store AS s
ON st.store_id = s.store_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3
order by 4 desc;

Question 4:
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2017, and what was the amount of the monthlypayments. 
Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers.


Solution:
WITH subquery_1 AS (SELECT c.customer_id AS customer_id,
						   c.first_name AS first_name,
						   c.last_name last_name,
						   COUNT(p.amount) num_payment,
						   SUM(p.amount) AS total_payment
					FROM customer AS c
					JOIN payment AS p
					ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
					GROUP BY 1, 2
					ORDER BY 5 DESC
					LIMIT 10)

SELECT CONCAT(first_name || ' ' || last_name) AS customer_name,
	   DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', p.payment_date) AS month,
	   COUNT(DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', p.payment_date)) AS num_of_pmt_per_month,
	    SUM(p.amount) AS total_amt_per_month
	   
FROM subquery_1
JOIN payment AS p
ON subquery_1.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;
